# Contribution Guidelines

## Reporting issues

- **Search for existing issues.** Please check to see if someone else has reported the same issue.
- **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, browser and version. Also, include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Project Setup

Refer to the [README](https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-profile/blob/master/README.md).

## Code Style

### JavaScript

JS files must pass JSHint using the provided [.jshintrc](https://raw.github.com/mozilla/webmaker-profile/master/.jshintrc) settings.

Additionally, JS files need to be run through [JSBeautify](https://github.com/einars/js-beautify) with the provided [.jsbeautifyrc](https://raw.github.com/mozilla/webmaker-profile/master/.jsbeautifyrc).

**TL;DR** Run `grunt clean` before pushing a commit. It will validate and beautify your JS.

#### Variable Naming

- `lowerCamelCase` General variables
- `UpperCamelCase` Constructor functions


### Jade / HTML

- Class names use hypenated case ( IE: *my-class-name* )

### LESS / CSS

- 2 space indentation

- For multiple, comma-separated selectors, place each selector on it's own line

## Testing

Any patch should be tested in as many of our [supported browsers](https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-profile/wiki/Browser-Support) as possible. Obviously, access to all devices is rare, so just aim for the best coverage possible. At a minimum please test in all available desktop browsers.

## Pull requests

- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes â€“ keep them simple and small. If possible, squash your commits.
- Try to share which browsers and devices your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request.
- If your PR resolves an issue, include **closes #ISSUE_NUMBER** in your commit message (or a [synonym](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages)).
