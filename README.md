# Webmaker Profile

Prototype of *USERNAME.makes.org* profile.

## Build Dependencies

- npm
- grunt CLI `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- bower `npm install -g bower`

## Setup

### Application Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gvn/webmaker-profile.git
cd webmaker-profile && npm install
```

### Service Setup

*NOTE: If you don't want to write service code, you can ignore this step.*

Profile consumes a stand-alone web service, [webmaker-profile-service](https://github.com/gvn/webmaker-profile-service). Eventually, this will run separate from the Profile app, but for development we are using `npm link` to use it as a node_module for ease of developing in tandem.

To set this up, first clone **webmaker-profile-service** into a new location (most likely parallel to **webmaker-profile**). Then `cd` into its directory and run `npm link`. Finally, `cd` into **webmaker-profile** and run `npm link webmaker-profile-service`.

## Grunt Tasks

- **grunt** - Recompile Jade and Less as needed for dev. Run a server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
- **grunt build** - Compile Jade, Less and JS for production and run JSHint.

## Indexes

There are two index HTML files that are generated from `index.jade`. For development you'll generally run `index.dev.html`, which has uncompiled JS for easier debugging. It also uses a version of the compiled LESS that has inline source annotations for debugging purposes.

The other index, `index.html`, is used for the production version of the app. It includes concatenated and minified versions of the app's JS and CSS.

## Localization

[https://github.com/gvn/webmaker-profile/wiki/Localization](https://github.com/gvn/webmaker-profile/wiki/Localization)

## Deploy to Heroku

Use the nodejs-grunt buildpack:
```bash
heroku create {yourname-profile} --buildpack https://github.com/mbuchetics/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt
git push heroku master
```
You can always set the buildpack config variable separately:
```bash
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/mbuchetics/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt.git
```
If you want to push up a branch other than master
```bash
git push heroku branchname:master
```
